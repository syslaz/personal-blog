### **The Changing Face of Technology**

Technology has always been a tool for growth, connection, and education. But somewhere along the way, we’ve lost that spark of curiosity. Today, much of the tech industry feels like it’s been reduced to a race for keywords, flashy resumes, and eye-catching LinkedIn profiles. Interviews focus on how well we can perform on a whiteboard rather than how deeply we understand our craft.

This shift impacts not just our industry but also the younger generation watching from the sidelines. Our cultural definition of success risks becoming synonymous with salary figures and social media clout rather than meaningful contributions or genuine passion for learning. I’ll admit, I’ve been swept up in this current at times myself.

But I believe we can redirect our focus—reconnecting with what first inspired so many of us to pursue careers in tech.

### **The Bigger Picture**

The challenges we face as a society extend far beyond the tech industry. A quick scroll through online forums or news feeds paints a troubling picture: rising frustration, eroding trust, and a sense of disconnection. Issues like mental health struggles, economic instability, and social divides dominate headlines, often leaving us wondering—how did we get here?

While technology has brought incredible advancements, it has also amplified the speed of our interactions and the scale of our problems. It’s easy to feel overwhelmed, but I believe there’s hope in remembering where we came from and what we stand for.

### **Who I Am and What I’ve Seen**

Born in 1996, I’ve had the unique experience of growing up on the cusp of two eras—analog and digital. I’ve witnessed firsthand the transformation of our culture and economy, from the dial-up days of the internet to today’s always-connected world. This perspective has shaped my understanding of how far we’ve come—and how far we still have to go.

One of my most vivid memories as a child was standing in my first-grade classroom, hand over heart, reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. It was a simple act, but it carried profound meaning: a reminder of unity, shared purpose, and belief in something greater than ourselves. Today, I wonder how often we reflect on those ideals.

### **Leadership in Action**

Leadership, whether in tech or society at large, should be rooted in service and understanding. The most successful organizations and communities are those where leaders ask “why”—why their work matters and how it serves the greater good. The U.S. Army, for example, thrives on this principle, building teams that value readiness, resilience, and tradition.

Similarly, America’s identity has always been tied to its people’s willingness to lead, sacrifice, and innovate. These values are why we’ve overcome challenges in the past and why I believe we can address the ones we face today.

### **Learning From History**

As we strive to rediscover the American Dream, it’s crucial to learn from both our triumphs and our failures. Our nation’s history is filled with moments of greatness—like the sacrifices of WWII veterans—and moments of reckoning, like the struggles for civil rights. Each of these chapters offers lessons that can guide us forward.

By embracing these lessons, we can foster a culture that values hard work, innovation, and compassion while acknowledging and addressing our mistakes.

### **What We Need Now**

Rebuilding the American Dream requires us to come together. Here’s how we can start:

1. **Create Space for Dialogue:** Open conversations with those who think differently. Listen with empathy and seek understanding.  
2. **Foster Resilience:** Support mental health, value our time, and prioritize well-being.  
3. **Inspire the Next Generation:** Teach kids the importance of community, curiosity, and respect for diverse perspectives.  

We can honor traditions like the Pledge of Allegiance while also respecting the freedom of dissent. By balancing pride in our history with a commitment to inclusivity, we can guide future generations to build a stronger, more united society.

### Final Thoughts  

America’s foundation wasn’t built by individuals chasing personal glory. It was built by people who believed in a shared vision of freedom, opportunity, and progress. From the Continental Army of 1776 to the everyday heroes of today, our country’s story is one of resilience and collaboration.

Let’s not lose sight of that story. Let’s come together to uphold the values that define us and inspire the next chapter of the American Dream.
