# Introduction

My name is Lazaro Brito, and I was born in Miami, FL, to Cuban immigrant parents who worked tirelessly to build a better future for my sister and me. Overcoming early language barriers as an ESOL student taught me persistence—a quality that later shaped my self-taught journey in technology.
At just five years old, my parents gifted me a computer, sparking my fascination with technology. By fifth grade, I was rebuilding PCs through Dell TechKnow, a school program that introduced me to IT. That same drive led me to spend countless hours teaching myself to code, creating game servers, and exploring the possibilities of software development.
By middle school, I had rewritten an entire backend system from scratch using Java to host private RuneScape servers, attracting hundreds of concurrent players. My project was one of the first to incorporate new HD graphics updates from upstream, setting it apart in the community. Long before "the cloud" became mainstream, I was managing servers for 500+ players on a machine powered by an AMD Opteron and 8GB of RAM—entirely on code I wrote myself.

# My First Startup and Lessons Learned

At 17, I co-founded a platform that automated gameplay for RuneScape. Our ambitious team achieved rapid growth, but my inexperience with business structure and legal frameworks led to critical mistakes. In 2015, I was ousted from the company, losing everything I’d worked for. That same year, I dropped out of university to focus on growing the business, a decision that seemed like a brutal defeat when things fell apart.
Without guidance, I pivoted, taking on labor-intensive jobs to make ends meet. Yet, these challenges taught me discipline and humility, shaping my approach to entrepreneurship.
Finding Stability and Returning to Tech

In 2018, I joined the Army in search of structure and stability. While nursing wasn’t my dream, becoming an LVN taught me adaptability, leadership, and the value of service. Balancing military duties, I rekindled my passion for tech, launching a gaming modifications platform that achieved financial success. Although I shut it down in 2023 following a cease-and-desist from Activision, this experience provided critical lessons about ethical innovation and the importance of aligning technology with community values.
The Cybersecurity Pivot

Building on my expertise in anti-cheat exploits and system integration and following my transition out of Millitary service after 6 years, I transitioned into cybersecurity and virtualization. Before Microsoft publicly announced their work on OpenVMM (a paravisor/VMM for Hyper-V / Azure VMs), I began developing a virtualization platform that would allow Linux systems to containerize respective Windows applications/games (like Adobe Photoshop) using Hyper-V enlightenments. Engineered to replicate the technology behind Window's Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Virtual Secure Mode (VSM), but in 'reverse'.
While dissecting out-of-tree source code hidden in Microsoft’s public Azure Linux repositories, I reverse-engineered critical components to modernize compatibility. The work was arduous—countless hours navigating undocumented sources and solving puzzles without a roadmap. Despite personal and financial pressures, I made significant progress.
Just as I was starting to connect the dots to a broader market need, Microsoft launched their open-source solution, overshadowing my efforts before I could even go public with them. It was a humbling moment, but instead of feeling defeated, I realized my independent work paralleled that of one of the world’s leading tech companies. It validated my skills and reignited my drive to innovate.

# Lessons, Growth, and the Road Ahead

This journey hasn’t been easy, but it’s taught me the value of resilience, curiosity, and the ability to adapt. My experiences with startups, military service, and technical innovation have shaped me into a problem-solver who thrives on challenges.
Looking forward, I aim to leverage my expertise in cybersecurity and software development to tackle emerging global challenges. I’m particularly passionate about creating tools that enhance security, efficiency, and accessibility across industries.
